## About Us

The rainbowfish-tech-collab, created by [Char](https://github.com/charburton18) and [Robin](https://github.com/robinallenaz), is a community of tech creatives focused on growing their knowledge of modern technologies, improving their skills with real-world projects, and fostering a positive and supportive learning environment.

### Why is it called "Rainbowfish"?

The Rainbow Fish is a children's book by Marcus Pfister that promotes generosity, kindness, and friendship. Read the story [here](https://milldamschool.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/09/The_rainbow_fish.pdf). Like the Rainbow Fish, we believe we are all better when we share our unique qualities with each other.
